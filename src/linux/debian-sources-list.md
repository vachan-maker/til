# Debian Mirrors
The sources file is located at `/etc/apt/sources.list`. More info on the sources.list file can be found on the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList).

Mirrors that I use:

- [NIT Calicut](https://mirror.nitc.ac.in/debian)
- [CUSAT](https://foss.cusat.ac.in/mirror/debian/)

More mirrors can be found on the [Free Software Mirrors in India](https://blog.sahilister.in/2024/10/free-software-mirrors-in-india/) page.
