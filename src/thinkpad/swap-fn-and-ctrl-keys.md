# Swap Fn and Ctrl Key
On thinkpads for some reason, the function and control keys are in a different position. I have no clue why Lenovo does this.

Anyway, if you prefer, you can swap the keys by using the BIOS. Please refer this [article by Lenovo](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/uk/products/desktops-and-all-in-ones/ideacentre-b-series-all-in-ones/ideacentre-b540p/3363/solutions/ht074187-how-to-swap-the-fn-function-and-ctrl-control-keyboard-keys-in-bios) to swap the function and control keys.
